# Waifu-Generator


So this repo contains a Notebook I made last year, in an attempt to generate Waifus (female anime character) faces using AutoEncoders. Although I created the repo for this project, I never really felt like throwing this project up on GitHub till now ðŸ˜…

Anyways, feel free to check the notebook out for some fun ML stuff. The model took a couple of hours to train, and I used Kaggle's kernels for it. Dataset source can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/splcher/animefacedataset), and my Kaggle Kernel [here](https://www.kaggle.com/naimish123/waifugenerator-ae)

All images were resized to 32x32x3, and the latent vector exists in 256 dimensions. I originally wanted to train it on 80x80x3 images, but due to memory issues and lack of access to a GPU, I settled for this resolution. I'll probably visit this project again in the future, if time and compute resources permit, to train a higher resolution, deeper AutoEncoder. Or even a GAN, who knows ðŸ˜„

There were 3 mains steps involved in this project:
1. Training an AutoEncoder to Reconstruct the images.
2. Generating images by randomly sampling from the Latent Space.
3. Visualising the Latent Space through t-SNE.

The results of each of the steps can be found below:
